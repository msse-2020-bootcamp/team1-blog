title: "Introducing Camille"

Today, it's my privilege to introduce my MSSE classmate Camille  Huang. Camille is from the Los Angeles area, where after growing up with a deep interest in the physical sciences, she decided to pursue a degree in chemisty. Initially, she was set to study hard science, not giving consideration to computer or data science. However, before transferring, Camille took an "Introduction to C++" course that she really enjoyed, and that inspired her to take more computer science courses once at UCLA.

Although it was too late to switch her major, Camille did take additional C++ coding courses at UCLA, and ended up supplementing her degree in Chemistry with a minor in bioinformatics. After hearing about the MSSE program, she felt that it was the perfect fit for her to continue learning about computational technology within the realm of chemistry. Also, Camille appreciates that the part-time nature of this program allows her the time to volunteer as a tutor, and work for educational equity in other areas of her life. 

Outside of academics, Camille enjoys eating her favorite food which is Japanese curry (just don't ask her to eat any carrots though!). Also, she enjoys listening to classical music, and she plays the Violin. She also picked up the keyboard and bass guitar in order to help out the worship team at her church when they were short a few musicians. And last but not least, Camille also enjoys playing strategy video games such as "Team Fight Tactics" on her PC.
