Ron Yadin grew up in Los Angeles.  
He went to college at UC Berkeley and earned a bachelors degree in Cell and Molecular Biology.  
Ron was always fascinated by the sciences.  He had an interest in pursuing medicine, in part because he had mostly seen scientific principles being applied in the context medical settings.  
During his time at UC Berkeley, he completed prerequisite requirements in preparation for medical school but did not apply for upcoming application cycle.  
Instead, Ron applied for both an internship and a job in the biotechnology industry during his final semester of college.  
Much to Ronâ€™s surprise, he landed both positions: working at the Joint Genome Institute in Walnut Creek and at Amyris, the company that he currently works for.

Ron was very happy that he ended up waiting to apply to medical school because after graduation he had the opportunity to work in the industry and see more faces of science.  
He also ended up exploring the social justice and social equity sides of science during this time.  
Ron chose MSSE because the curriculum both teaches the technical side of the field while simultaneously enabling more power for communities that are traditionally disempowered.

Ron does not currently have any pets, but he grew up with cats and would love to have one of his own one day.  
Ron also is a huge music enthusiast and plays multiple instruments.  
He primarily sings and plays the guitar, and he has also taken up the drums, keyboard, and bass.
