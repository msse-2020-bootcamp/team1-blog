title: “More Concepts in C++ and the creating Third Version of the Monte Carlo Simulation Code”

## Overview
Today marks the seventh lesson and homework session of the MSSE bootcamp and a major transitionary point in the course.  We learned more about the intricacies of coding in the programming language C++.  Using the tools learned in the last couple of days, we have now undertaken the task of completing the third version of the Monte Carlo simulation code, which is implementing the project using the programming language C++.  


## Coding in C++: Arrays, Pointers, Memory, and Vectors
Four important C++ coding concepts were added to our toolkit today.  Arrays are a concept that are both used in the Python and C++ coding languages.  Arrays in python constant size because the sizes must be known at compiling time.  Just as in Python, arrays in C++ are zero-indexed.  The values used in the array are initialized in a set of curly braces.  Pointers are another concept that was learned today.  A pointer is an object used in C++ as well as other languages that stores the memory address of another variable.  Another tool used in the C++ programming language is vectors.  Vectors are important because they are dynamic and resizable arrays.  These incredibly important and useful properties of vectors allow them to function in the C++ programming language in a way that is similar to lists in Python.


## Writing and Implementing the C++ Version of the Monte Carlo Project
With hard work, persistence, and a little grit, Team 1 has finished writing the C++ code for the Monte Carlo simulation code in just one day.  In the project, we have utilized the C++ coding concepts of arrays, pointers, memory, and vectors, which were all covered in today’s lecture material.  We look forward to running this code and gathering and preparing the information needed to create a great final project and presentation.
